# Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using the NSL-KDD Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset. The aim of the project is to compare and evaluate different machine learning models for network intrusion detection.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files and loading scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and checkpoints.
- `results/`: Results including metrics, visualizations, and performance comparisons.

## Requirements
To install the necessary packages, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
